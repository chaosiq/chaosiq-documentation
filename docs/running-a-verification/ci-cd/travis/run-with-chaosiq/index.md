This section explains how to configure and use Travis for running
[Chaos Toolkit][ChaosToolkit] experiments and publishing the results to [ChaosIQ][ChaosIQ].

To be able to fetch assets from ChaosIQ, as well as pushing back results,
for both experiments and verifications, you'll need to setup a settings file
with a valid token and selected targeted organization & team.

Please refer to these documentation links, to [signin to ChaosIQ]
[SignInChaosIQ] with a token and select your default [organization]
[SelectDefaultOrg] and [team][SelectDefaultTeam].

## Add the ChaosIQ Extension

You will need to add the ChaosIQ extension to the Github repository we setup in the previous section. Open the ```requirements.txt``` file and add the line:

```
chaosiq-cloud
```
Then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the plugin which will allow you to generate a settings file to use with Travis.

## Configure the ChaosIQ Settings

You will need to create a settings file to use with our experiment. In your terminal window run:

```
(chaostk) $ chaos --settings ./settings.yaml signin
  ChaosIQ Cloud url [https://console.chaosiq.io]:
  ChaosIQ Cloud token:
  Experiments and executions will be published to team 'Staging' in organization 'ChaosIQ'
  ChaosIQ Cloud details saved at ./settings.yaml
```

When the *signin* command prompts for the token paste in your token for ChaosIQ.

!!! warning
    **The ```settings.yaml``` contains sensitive information and must not be committed to your Github repository, add it to your ```.gitignore``` file now.**

You can if you wish run your experiment locally to confirm that it will publish your execution to ChaosIQ with the settings file you have configured, if you wish to do this run:

```
chaos --settings settings.yaml run experiment.json
```

You can the login to [ChaosIQ Executions][ChaosIQExecutions] page to confirm your execution has been published.

## Encrypt the Settings File

As mentioned above the settings file contains sensitive information and should not be pushed to your Github repository. Travis has a feature to enable you to encrypt a file then use that file as part of you job execution on Travis, this is detailed in the [Travis Documentation][TravisFileEncryption].

### Install the Travis CLI

To encrypt a file and to use that encrypted file on your Travis build you will need to install the Travis CLI, see the [Travis CLI installation][TravisCliInstall] instructions. Once installed you will need to use the Travis CLI to login  in to your Travis account with the following command:

```
travis login --com
```

You can now encrypt the ```settings.yaml``` and the Travis CLI will share the secure encryption variables with you Travis account. Encrypt the settings file with the following command:

```
travis encrypt-file settings.yaml --add --com
```
This will give the following output:

```
encrypting settings.yaml for gtfisher/travis-test
storing result as settings.yaml.enc
storing secure env variables for decryption


Overwrite the config file /Users/grant/dev/try/travis-test/.travis.yml with the content below?

This reformats the existing file.

---
language: python
python:
- '3.7'
install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
script:
- chaos run experiment.json
before_install:
- openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_fdb844fae20b_key -iv $encrypted_fdb844fae20b_iv
  -in settings.yaml.enc -out settings.yaml -d


(y/N) y

Make sure to add settings.yaml.enc to the git repository.
Make sure not to add settings.yaml to the git repository.
Commit all changes to your .travis.yml.
```
!!! Note
    In the above output *gtfisher* is the Travis account name and *travis-test* is the name of the Github repository.

This encrypts the ```settings.yaml``` file into  ```settings.yaml.enc```, it also setups secure environment variables for decryption and updates the travis config to use those environment variables.

You now need to update the ```chaos run``` command in the ```.travis.yml``` file so it uses the settings.yaml file that will be decrypted from the   ```settings.yaml.enc``` when the build runs. In the ```.travis.yml``` change the chaos run command to:

```
script:
 - chaos --settings settings.yaml run experiment.json
```

## Run the new build on Travis

You now need to commit the following files your Github repository:

```
settings.yaml.enc
requirements.txt
.travis.yml
.gitignore
```

 This will cause a new build to be triggered. If you go to the [Travis console][TravisConsole] you will see the job executing and eventually the output from the job execution:

![Travis Job with ChaosIQ][TravisJob]

The output shows at the top the two secure environment variables and shows the output of the experiment running. This includes the information that the experiment will be published to ChaosIQ and lists the URL when the execution is published to. If you navigate to that URL you will see a  detailed view of the execution, if you expand the General section and you can confirm the execution is part of a Travis job:

![Execution Detail][ExecutionDetail]


!!! Note
    If you want to run a [Verification][RunAndVerify] instead of an experiment all you need to do is add a verification file to the Github repository and change the ```chaos run``` command with ```chaos verify```. The Verification will run as part of the Travis build and the results will be published to the Insights view on ChaosIQ.



In this section we have:

* Added the ChaosIQ plugin by updating the ```requirements.txt```.
* Created a ```settings.yaml``` file and encrypted it for use on Travis.
* Updated the ```.travis.yaml``` file to use the encrypted file and change the chaos command to use the settings file.
* Pushed the changes to the Github repository to trigger a build
* The build has executed and published the execution on the Executions page on ChaosIQ
