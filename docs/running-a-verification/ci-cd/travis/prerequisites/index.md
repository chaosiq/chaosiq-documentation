To run Chaos Toolkit as part of a Travis CI build a number of prerequisites are required:

* [Chaos Toolkit][ChaosToolkit] installed and running on your local machine.
* If you want to run with ChaosIQ you will need a [ChaosIQ account][ChaosIQ]  account and a [Token for Chaos IQ][ChaosPlugin].
* A [Travis CI][TravisCI] account.
* A [Github][Github] account (An alternative is to use [Bitbucket][BitBucket], but this is not covered here).
* Owner permissions for a project hosted on [Github][Github].
