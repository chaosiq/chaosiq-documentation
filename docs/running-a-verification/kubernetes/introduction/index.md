Running ChaosIQ Verifications and Experiments from inside a Kubernetes cluster
is possible thanks to the open source Chaos Toolkit [Kubernetes operator]
[K8sCrdRepo].
This allows you to run remotely instead of from the standard command line on local
machines.

First, you will need to deploy the operator in your cluster. To do so,
please refer to the official open source Chaos Toolkit [documentation]
[DeployTheOperator].
