At ChaosIQ, we believe that reliability is a practice. That's why we founded the [Chaos Toolkit][ctk] free and open source project ecosystem, and now the [Reliability Toolkit][rtk]. Together the Reliability Toolkit, along with the Chaos Toolkit and a whole host of other tools you can pick from, provide a place to practice reliability where you and your team can work together on making your systems more reliable.

Reliability is not something you _have_, it is something you _do_ or, more accurately, something you _practice_. Here you will learn why practicing reliability is important, how to do it, what tools to select from to help build your own reliability toolbox, and most importantly how to prove and improve the reliability of your own systems.
