To be able to fetch assets from ChaosIQ, as well as pushing back results, for both experiments and verifications, you'll need to set-up a settings file with a valid token and selected targeted organization & team.

## Generate a Token

A token is generated from the  ChaosIQ [Tokens page](https://console.chaosiq.io/tokens).

![Tokens Page][TokensPage]

[TokensPage]: ./images/tokens-page.png

Enter a token name and click the `Generate Token` button:

![Copy Token][CopyToken]

[CopyToken]: ./images/copy-token.png

Click the `Copy To Clipboard` button and the token will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be added to your Chaos Toolkit CLI by signing in to ChaosIQ.
