# Organizations and Teams

## What are organizations and teams?

The system's resilience should never be the role of a single person. Even if you are the only one whose job title explicitly mentions Resilience, Resilience should be a company-wide goal. When several people are  building Objectives running Verifications experiments, they might want to see what the others are up to. A manager, even if not running Verifications themselves, might want to have a global view of the team's achievements.

In ChaosIQ, Organizations allow a high level view of everything that is happening. Most of the time, your Organization will represent your company. In your organization view, you can get a list of all Objectives and Verifications ever run and published.

Teams are where the work happens. They are shared workspaces where people can collaborate on Objectives, Verifications and Insights. Invite members of your Organization to your team and unleash the benefits of Verifications on your system. Objectives and Verifications will enhance your systems resilience and greatly increase user satisfaction.

## Creating an organization

An organization is created when a person signs in to ChaosIQ without having been previously invited to join an organization.
