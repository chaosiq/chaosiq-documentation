# Introduction to Organizations and Teams

A system's resilience is rarely the responsibility of a single person. Even if you are someone whose job title explicitly mentions resilience, resilience is a cross-socio-technical system goal. Everyone should be aware of the system's objectives and how, and when,  those objectives are being verified using ChaosIQ, so that's why we support the familiar setup of Organizations and Teams to help everyone organize their efforts.

Organizations allow a high-level view of everything that is happening. Most of the time, your organization in ChaosIQ will represent your real-life organization or company. In your organization view, you can get a list of all objectives and verifications ever run and pushed to ChaosIQ.

Teams are where the work happens. They are shared workspaces where people can collaborate on objectives, verifications, insights and even see the activity on action items.
